## Example Application: RAG using Endee

This repository includes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demo
located in the `rag_app/` directory, showcasing how Endee can be used
as a vector database for semantic retrieval.

# Endee: High-Performance Open Source Vector Database

**Endee (nD)** is a specialized, high-performance vector database built for speed and efficiency. This guide covers supported platforms, dependency requirements, and detailed build instructions using both our automated installer and manual CMake configuration.

---

## 1. System Requirements

Before installing, ensure your system meets the following hardware and operating system requirements.

### Supported Operating Systems

* **Linux**: Ubuntu(22.04, 24.04, 25.04) Debian(12, 13), Rocky(8, 9, 10), Centos(8, 9, 10), Fedora(40, 42, 43)
* **macOS**: Apple Silicon (M Series) only.

### Required Dependencies

The following packages are required for compilation.

 `clang-19`, `cmake`, `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`

> **Note:** The build system requires **Clang 19** (or a compatible recent Clang version) supporting C++20.

---

## 2. Quick Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to build **ndd** is using the included `install.sh` script. This script handles OS detection, dependency checks, and configuration automatically.

### Usage

Run the script from the root of the repository. You **must** provide arguments for the build mode and/or CPU optimization.

```bash
./install.sh [BUILD_MODE] [CPU_OPTIMIZATION]
```

### Build Arguments

You can combine one **Build Mode** and one **CPU Optimization** flag.

#### Build Modes

| Flag | Description | CMake Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--release` | **Default.** Optimized release build. |  |
| `--debug_all` | Enables full debugging symbols. | `-DND_DEBUG=ON -DDEBUG=ON` |
| `--debug_nd` | Enables NDD-specific logging/timing. | `-DND_DEBUG=ON` |

#### CPU Optimization Options

Select the flag matching your hardware to enable SIMD optimizations.

| Flag | Description | Target Hardware |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--avx2` | Enables AVX2 (FMA, F16C) | Modern x86_64 Intel/AMD |
| `--avx512` | Enables AVX512 (F, BW, VNNI, FP16) | Server-grade x86_64 (Xeon/Epyc) |
| `--neon` | Enables NEON (FP16, DotProd) | Apple Silicon / ARMv8.2+ |
| `--sve2` | Enables SVE2 (INT8/16, FP16) | ARMv9 / SVE2 compatible |

> **Note:** The `--avx512` build configuration enforces mandatory runtime checks for specific instruction sets. To successfully run this build, your CPU must support **`avx512` (Foundation), `avx512_fp16`, `avx512_vnni`, `avx512bw`, and `avx512_vpopcntdq`**; if any of these extensions are missing, the database will fail to initialize and exit immediately to avoid runtime crashes.


### Example Commands

**Build for Production (Intel/AMD with AVX2):**

```bash
./install.sh --release --avx2
```

**Example Build for Debugging (Apple Silicon):**

```bash
./install.sh --debug_all --neon
```

---

## 3. Manual Build (Advanced)

If you prefer to configure the build manually or integrate it into an existing install pipeline, you can use `cmake` directly.

### Step 1: Prepare Build Directory

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

### Step 2: Configure

Run `cmake` with the appropriate flags. You must manually define the compiler if it is not your system default.

**Configuration Flags:**

* **Debug Options:**
* `-DDEBUG=ON` (Enable debug symbols/O0)
* `-DND_DEBUG=ON` (Enable internal logging)


* **SIMD Selectors (Choose One):**
* `-DUSE_AVX2=ON`
* `-DUSE_AVX512=ON`
* `-DUSE_NEON=ON`
* `-DUSE_SVE2=ON`


**Example (x86_64 AVX512 Release):**

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DUSE_AVX512=ON \
      ..
```

### Step 3: Compile

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

---

## 4. Running ndd

After a successful build, the binary will be generated in the `build/` directory.

### Binary Naming

The output binary name depends on the SIMD flag used during compilation:

* `ndd-avx2`
* `ndd-avx512`
* `ndd-neon` (or `ndd-neon-darwin` for mac)
* `ndd-sve2`

### Runtime Environment Variables

Some enviroment variables **ndd** reads at runtime:

* `NDD_DATA_DIR`: Defines the data directory
* `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN`: Optional authentication token (see below)

### Authentication

**ndd** supports two authentication modes:

**Open Mode (No Authentication)** - Default when `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
# All APIs work without authentication
./build/ndd-avx2
curl http://{{BASE_URL}}/api/v1/index/list
```

**Token Mode** - When `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN` is set:
```bash
# Generate a secure token
export NDD_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
./build/ndd-avx2

# All protected APIs require the token in Authorization header
curl -H "Authorization: $NDD_AUTH_TOKEN" http://{{BASE_URL}}/api/v1/index/list
```

### Execution Example

To run the database using the AVX2 binary and a local `data` folder:

```bash
# 1. Create the data directory
mkdir -p ./data

# 2. Export the environment variable and run
export NDD_DATA_DIR=$(pwd)/data
./build/ndd-avx2
```

Alternatively, as a single line:

```bash
NDD_DATA_DIR=./data ./build/ndd-avx2
```

## 5. Docker Deployment

We provide a Dockerfile for easy containerization. This ensures a consistent runtime environment and simplifies the deployment process across various platforms.

### Build the Image

You **must** specify the target architecture (`avx2`, `avx512`, `neon`, `sve2`) using the `BUILD_ARCH` build argument. You can optionally enable a debug build using the `DEBUG` argument.

```bash
# Production Build (AVX2) (for x86_64 systems)
docker build --ulimit nofile=100000:100000 --build-arg BUILD_ARCH=avx2 -t endee-oss:latest -f ./infra/Dockerfile .

# Debug Build (Neon) (for arm64, mac apple silicon)
docker build --ulimit nofile=100000:100000 --build-arg BUILD_ARCH=neon --build-arg DEBUG=true -t endee-oss:latest -f ./infra/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Container

The container exposes port `8080` and stores data in `/data` inside container. You should persist this data using a docker volume.

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v endee-data:/data \
  --name endee-server \
  endee-oss:latest
```

### Alternatively: Docker Compose

You can also use `docker-compose` to run the service.

1. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

---

## 6. Running Docker container from registry

You can run Endee directly using the pre-built image from Docker Hub without building locally.

### Using Docker Compose

Create a new directory for Endee:

```bash
mkdir endee && cd endee
```

Inside this directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and copy the following content into it:

```yaml
services:
  endee:
    image: endeeio/endee-server:latest
    container_name: endee-server
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      NDD_NUM_THREADS: 0
      NDD_AUTH_TOKEN: ""  # Optional: set for authentication
    volumes:
      - endee-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  endee-data:
```

Then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
